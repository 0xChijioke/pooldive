# Pooldive üèäüèΩ

Welcome to Pooldive, a tool for exploring and engaging with liquidity pools in Ethereum. Pooldive aims to simplify the process of navigating and understanding pools from different protocols such as Uniswap and Balancer.



## Features (üöß Work in progress)

- **User-Friendly Interface:** An intuitive interface empowers users to explore DeFi pools effortlessly.
  
- **Pool Exploration:** Dive into Uniswap v3 and Balancer v2 pools with ease.
  
- **Liquidity Provision:** Seamlessly participate in liquidity provision as the process undergoes refinement and optimization for user convenience.
  
- **Arbitrage Opportunities:** Identify potential arbitrage opportunities for strategic decision-making.
  
- **Composed Liquidity:** Explore the power of composed liquidity as additional protocols integrate with Pooldive, expanding access to decentralized finance opportunities.



## Tech Stack üõ†Ô∏è

Pooldive is built with the following technologies:

- [Scaffold-ETH 2](https://github.com/scaffold-eth/scaffold-eth-2) - Open source forkable Ethereum dev stack.
- [Apollo Client](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/) - State management and GraphQL client.
- [The Graph](https://thegraph.com/) - Query protocol for decentralized data.
- [Uniswap SDK](https://github.com/Uniswap/v3-sdk) - SDK for interacting with the Uniswap protocol.
- [Balancer SDK](https://github.com/balancer/balancer-sdk) - SDK for interacting with the Balancer protocol.



## Quickstart

To get started with PoolDive, follow the steps below:

1. Clone this repo & install dependencies

```
git clone https://github.com/0xChijioke/pooldive.git
cd pooldive
yarn install
```

2. Run a local network in the first terminal:

```
yarn chain
```

This command starts a local Ethereum network using Hardhat. The network runs on your local machine and can be used for testing and development. You can customize the network configuration in `hardhat.config.ts`.

3. On a second terminal, deploy the test contract:

```
yarn deploy
```

This command deploys a test smart contract to the local network. The contract is located in `packages/hardhat/contracts` and can be modified to suit your needs. The `yarn deploy` command uses the deploy script located in `packages/hardhat/deploy` to deploy the contract to the network. You can also customize the deploy script.

4. On a third terminal, start your NextJS app:

```
yarn start
```

## Usage üí° 

Explore DeFi pools, participate in liquidity provision, and identify arbitrage opportunities using the intuitive user interface of Pooldive.

## Future Plans üî≠

1. Chain Agnosticism
2. Enhanced Functionalities
    + Swapping
    + Flash Swaps
3. Protocol Expansion
    To further amplify access to liquidity and uncover additional opportunities, supported protocols will be expanded.
